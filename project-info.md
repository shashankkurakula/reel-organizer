This is a React + Vite PWA app that helps users organize the their instagram saved reels / posts. Instagram has an option to save reel / post to their profile and let them add to collections, but if an user have 100's of reels / posts that they have saved it's very hard to find them as instagram donot offer any feature to search / filter. so my idea is to create an application that allow users to import any reel / post from instagram to our insta-reel-organizer application and allow users to add a title, description, add collection(s) and create tag(s). with our searcg and filter functionality users will be able to search the imported reels / posts with title, tag. 

Meta is allowing developers to use their free API which also features information regarding the saved reels and posts, to to be able to use it we need to have a working application and once META reviews our application we will get approval and will be provided with API key to use it. but till then we will let users manually import reel / post one at a time and let them provide title, description collection(s) and tag(s).

1. Title: each reel can have a title (no need to be unique)
2. Collection: Each reel can be a part of collection(s). collection are unique and any reel can be a part of one or more collection.
3. Tag: Tags help user to filter thei reels / posts easily. tags are unique and a reel can have one or more tags.

what is the actual idea behind this App?
I use instagram a lot in my free time. and i usually come across many useful reels / post like recipies, AI related, job related, interview tips, workout and gym related and i save them. now i have over 300 reels saved to a collection called recipies. one day i wanted to cook a chicken recipe i liked a lot and started looking for it in the saved reels collection called recipies... once i opened the recipes collection there are hundreds of recipies and there is no way for me to search for the particular recipe i have saved before (i am not sure how the thumbnail looked like, or when i have saved the recipe reel) so i started scrolling through all the reels (reels saved in a collection are viewed in a 3x5 format and only the thumbnails are viewed unless you click a particular reel and the you can watch the reel) and i'm lost and there's no way for me to find the particular chicken recipe i have saved. so i got the idea to help users like me to import the reels they saved and help them to search and filter.
